# R Basics

## Case study: US Gun Murders

## The very basics

### Objects

Suppose a high school student asks us for help solving several quadratic equations of the form \$ax\^2+bx+c=0\$. The quadratic formula gives us the solutions:

$$\frac{b+\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$ and

$$
\frac{b-\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
$$

which of course change depending on the values of \$a\$, \$b\$, and \$c\$. One advantage of programming languages is that we can define variables and write expressions with these variables, similar to how we do so in math, but obtain a numeric solution. We will write out general code for the quadratic equation below, but if we are asked to solve \$x\^2+x−1=0\$, then we define:

    a <- 1
